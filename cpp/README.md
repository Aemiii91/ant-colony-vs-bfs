# C++ project

This is the C++ part of our project.


## Code Convention

- Use `PascalCase` for start types (such as classes, structs, typedefs, and public functions).
- Use `camelCase` for all other names (variables).
- Use `camelCase` and prefix with `_` for private and protected functions.
- C++ interfaces are named with a `Interface` suffix, and abstract base classes with an `Abstract` prefix.
- Member variables are `camelCase` and referenced with `this->` or `this.` accordingly.
- Accessors for a private variable `_foo` are named `foo()` and `setFoo()`.
- Global constants are ALL CAPS.
- Global variables are not allowed.
- If the main responsibility of a file is to implement a particular class, then the name of the file should match that class

ownAlgorithm/DFSBranchLimitAlgorithm files contain the K-DFS algorithm
